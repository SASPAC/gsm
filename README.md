## `gsm` - *Generate Secure Macros* to keep your code secret

---

The **GSM** (Generate Secure Macros) package allows
to create secured macros stored in SAS Proc FCMP functions.

The dataset with functions can be shared between different operating systems
and allows to generate macros on site without showing their code.
